    "1. There is significant variance in pass rates between schools\n",
    "2. Pass rates do not vary significantly between grades within the same school\n",
    "3. Spending per student does not seem to have the effect expected (more spending does not result in higher passing rates). Infact, it looks like higher funding lowers passing rate, hence funding should be reduced. However, this assesment needs further analysis by considering other factors that possibly have a higher impact. For example, does funding have an effect within a particular the school type. On doing this, we can make two conslusions. First, within a certain school type, where funding is similar, there is not much difference. Second, that Charter schools, which have comparitively lower funding per student, do much better in terms of passing rate. Hence it is concluding that the type of school has a higher impact, but funding as such does not (lowering funding for any given school is not going to improve pass rate).\n",
    "4. School size has a negative effect on pass rates above a threshhold (~ 2000)\n",
    "5. School type has a significant effect on pass rates, with charter schools performing much better than district schoolsd \n",
    "6. Recommended actions to improve passing rate based on above analysis is add more charter schools, and reduce school size to less than 2000 students. Budget for this could be partially realized by reducing the funding for highly funded schools and ensuring all schools have a similar funding."
